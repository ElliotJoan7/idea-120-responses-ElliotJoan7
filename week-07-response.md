I definitely agree with the problem Bridle has set forth. I've always gotten the
heeby jeebies going anywhere near kids YouTube, and I don't think that's a
coincidence. I think his cause of the solution is on the money as well. People
care more about churning out dollars than giving kids something appropriate
and safe to watch, and it's disgusting. When I start thinking to myself "when I
have kids, they're going straight to adult YouTube" without a second thought,
then there's a problem.

As for the solution, I couldn't really extract any overt "answer" to this
problem from Bridle. However, I do agree that it's mainly YouTube's responsibility
to handle the problems of their own website. I think what Bridle definitely
implies is that one of the main problems is being able to massively profit off
of kids content. I don't know if I agree so much with doing away with this feature
because of course it's going to be another algorithm running it, and surely
wholesome kid's content and truly adult content that looks like it's for kids
from a computer's perspective will be caught in the crossfire. I personally
think Bridle has neglected a key aspect of capitalizing on content by putting
*all* the blame on the internet, algorithms, and content creators: we must
also control *demand.* Why are four-year-olds being handed an iPad long enough
to consume hours of this content at a time in the first place? I think there's
a larger societal problem of parents using devices as a sort of "shut up"
button for their kids, and this is an aspect that needs to be addressed.
I think the internet should have a safe place for each age group like Bridle
implies, yes, but I also think kid's need to grow and develop mostly outside
the internet and only really be allowed on it without supervision when they
can cognitively have a deep understanding of what they're looking at.
