1. Can video games ever become true folk games?
2. What is the line between creating an experience and actually creating a game?
3. How do complex systems make games the way they are?

I'm writing about the second question because it's something I need to figure
out for my project. I want to make a gender dysphoria simulator, but am wondering
how this would translate into an actual game. The difference between an experience
and a game seems to be either the relationship between players or player and
characters. In the case of simulation games, it's the relationship between player
and game maker.

Games in general serve the purpose of, well first of all being fun, but second
of all simulating some sort of situation with varying of realism. Simulation
games are just the purest form of that. Take my game for example. My game is
going to attempt to simulate what it's like to experience dysphoria while trying
to carry on with life, but in order for it to work, it'll require some cooperation
between me and the player. Especially because I'm a less than beginner coder. If I
I instruct the player to do this or that action with their nondominant hand,
and they don't, the whole thing just won't work. If a few people agree that they're
suddenly immune to the tagger, tag doesn't work.

So I suppose the answer is... the honor system? That's a bit of a weird conclusion,
but considering every true game exists on a backbone of cooperation, it makes
sense. With an experience you can do whatever the hell you want. An experience
can just be breathing. Even with rules that still stands. Case and point if you
stop breathing you die, see, there's a rule. A game, however, is putting yourself
in a box for a moment.
