I think I'm really only going to include what we've done here in class. I don't
want the point of the portfolio to get too muddied. There will be 4 pages, the
first one with three sections linking to the others. Each project will have its
own page, title, link (if necessary), images, and explanation. I've written my
personal titles to all these projects, but the fourth one is incorrect. I had
a different idea at literally the last second so now "Green Finch" is gonna be
"Socks in the Water." The new idea is essentially a dysphoria simulator, making
the player play as whichever character they look the least like, play certain
parts with their non dominant hand, listen to the game slightly louder or quieter
than they like, etc. I got sidetracked, anyway, Each page is going to look slightly
different to enhance the medium of each, but they'll all have the title and
explanation in the top left corner.
