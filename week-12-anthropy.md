First of all, there's a really simple reason video games should be accessible
for anyone to makes that has nothing to do with representation: every other art
form is. If we can pick up a pencil and draw something whenever we want, take
out our phone and take a picture whenever we want, or type a poem whenever we want,
or get some friends together and put on a modest play for family whenever we want,
why can't we make a simple video game whenever we want? Many strive for video games
to be respected as any other art form, but until it agrees to follow the same rules,
I don't see how it can truly complete that goal.

Aside from elevating video games to the status of true art form, breaking the
echo chamber Anthropy described in her article is a noble cause that makes perfect
sense, and I fear I don't have much to add. If the common person was able to make
and even distribute a game, it'll provide greater chance of representation,
and that's important because video games are an art and art is quite dangerous
if dominated by one voice. Simple enough.

It's not just a matter of "we can have more queer or poc people in games," which
the already existing straight male audience would probably groan hard at,
it's that the same type of person is inevitably going to make the same type of game,
and that's boring. Besides, even if we can rely on the already existing game making
population to have diverse enough experiences to make games interesting and profound
for everybody, having an accessible simplified version takes away the monetary
risk factor.

To make video game creation accessible for everybody would on some level mean making
coding accessible to everybody. This can benefit other art forms as well. Most
art forms are always looking for a way to expand to new horizons and do things
they never thought possible. Imagine implementing coding to easily create incredibly
complex and immersive projection backgrounds for theatre. Perhaps maybe those simple
"do it yourself" game making programs we keep talking about will inspire other types
of artists to practice their craft in a way that was previously unavailable to them. 
video games need illustrators, composers, and writers, right?
