<p> This quote can be understood by viewing the internet as the ultimate neutralizer
of intent. What is that incredibly pretentious mumbo jumbo? Well basically
When someone puts themselves out there online, it's impossible to avoid the element
of truly being exposed. Even something that's carefully staged, the *way* it's done
can tell a great deal about the creator. I know interactive media means something very
literal, just basically anything you're able to click on and manipulate,
but what comes to mind most often for me when I hear that word is parasocial relationships.
these kinds of relationships are often involuntary and just a side effect of being
allowed into somebody's life or creative vision from a distance. We have to consciously
choose to "identify with someone else's mental structure" because otherwise we insert
our own biases and experiences into some strangers work or even personal life no matter
how much we tell ourselves we're not going to. Being mindful of this is something
that's asked of us because it's a necessary precaution and our duty to be good people. </p>

<p> It's difficult to pinpoint how pieces of humongous internet companies reveal things
like identity and mental structure because those things are purely human. When
something gets as big as YouTube, it's nearly impossible to identify the human
behind it. I mean, there's a reason everyone says "the stupid algorithm isn't
pushing my stuff," or "damn it, a bot took down my post!" However, I think
that in it of itself is a fairly big clue as to the mental structure of the original
creator. There's something... *otherworldly* about them, almost alien and Eldredge,
and they must be *aware* of this to some extent. YouTube is run by a vast team of people
and bots, and for the most part they don't try particularly hard to attach one relatable
human personality like Tumblr (quite awkwardly) does. In this there's an element of honesty,
not trying to hide that the creator's "identity" is essentially obsolete. Why does it matter? </P>
