<p>I never realized how eerily relevant my YouTube ads are to very personal things
in my life until I read the article by O'Neil. For example, I never made the correlation
between getting a university of phoenix ad almost every time I went online last year
and the rough patch with my mental health, which, having the priveledged of owning a
private computer, I'm very open about in my search results. I've also gotten a weirdly
large amount of ads urging me to go to nursing school. I thought it was just a
popular career path, but now I'm thinking it was probably my several trips to
web md when a loved one was in the process of getting diagnosed with a chronic illness
and seemingly getting know where. Now that I'm aware of this uncomfortable prying
into my personal life, I kind of just... don't care. I mean yah the idea it's creepy,
but at the end of the day *I* decide what to do. I know I'm not gonna drop everything
and go to nursing school at the University of Phoenix. I don't believe I'm particularly
subject to those methods.</p>

<p>I am, however, subject to false statistics, whether it be
first hand, or taking the fall for somebody else falling for it. For example, I was
sitting in the kitchen roped into an incredibly awkward conversation with my dad
that quickly dissolved into being interrogated about how "suspicious" it is there's
"so many kids who think they're transgender now". You know, as you do, and
statistics quickly got involved. My dad pulled up a statistic from... honestly who knows
where, he didn't actually show it to me, that said only 0.02% of America's population
is "actually" transgender. This number, as Chalabi states, did not align with my life experiences,
and I quickly pointed out several probable faults to this claim, including an almost
guaranteed small sample size due to those who are closeted, nonbinary individuals, and those
who's transition is not on any sort of legal or medical record. I was noted that 0.02%
of the population is nearly six and a half million people. The point of all this is,
untrustworthy or misleading statistics can and do cause real life misconceptions and even prejudice.
In addition, although *I'm* not gonna fall for targeted ads, I know many people will. I don't
want them to have their lives unnecessarily turned upside down from some millionaire to make
a few more bucks. Besides, it would be one thing if these systems benefited small business
owners or regular people, but they don't. You'll notice these methods are only really employed
by large companies, the capital elite. There's no equality in the system, so removing it
all together would be the way to go. </p>
