This is an example of a meme that's difficult to divorce from its original context 
and still provide the same signifieds. If you change the medium to fit the tone of 
the text, you take away its humor, but if you change it to enhance the humor more,
the legitimacy of the actual text can be lost.

Message 1: the straight forward text is describing a societal issue that trans people
often face

message 2: the original screencap is that of a person grossly
failing to identify a butterfly correctly, asking if it's a bird. This image is used to 
signify not only a lack of understanding, but one so obviously false it's to a hilarious 
degree. This puts the text in the point of view of the trans community because this is something
we as a community see as prevalent yet ridiculous to an obvious degree.

message 3: The lack of context as well as the slightly condescending tone of the text indicates
that this piece of media was likely made by a trans person for only the trans community to immediately
be able to understand.

Let's say this is not a meme but instead an opinion piece in a respected news article. 
It was get its textual message across in a likely more accessible to a trans *and* 
cis audience given the broader opportunity to provide context and analysis. However, 
the original point of the media wasn't to build understanding across communities and 
advocate for a marginalized group, it was to build comradery with in a marginalized group
by using humor to cope with an issue we've likely all encountered.
