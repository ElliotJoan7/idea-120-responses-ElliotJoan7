I don't think Murray was correct in her prediction as it was. Not because
there's truly nothing like it still, but because what actually happened required
the extra hoop of predicting the social media boom. Her idea, in my opinion,
was pretty unsustainable. In order to film every possible outcome of a show, you'd
have production times that last incredibly long and actors working themselves
to death. She was basically talking about filming a several hour long play with
film actors. In addition in order to "follow an actor," there's have to be somewhere
to follow them *to*. It would cost a lot more to have a set that actually functions
as what it is. The closest thing I can think of is Black Mirror's *Bandersnatch*,
but even that had to be carefully controlled following only the many possibilities
of one character. Besides, it's still one of a kind. There is, however, such
thing as an "ARG," or "Alternate reality game." This is an interactive narrative
housed on one or more social media platforms. The viewer, or player, is meant
to take multiple paths to solve the mystery of the story, the genre greatly
favoring horror. It's common place to never acknowledge the fiction, keeping
the illusion alive even at the expense of some worried players calling the police
in case there really *is* a girl on YouTube who's being watched by a mysterious
figure. With this, Murray's prediction came somewhat to fruition, just not
in the way she thought.

Murray's prediction doesn't compare too incredibly closely to the technology
used in the Mandalorian, but there are certainly similarities. This technology
could begin to effectively solve the problem I posed earlier: you have to be
able to follow the actors to another realistic setting. Really other then
that, I fail to see how this connects. Murray's idea was a storytelling method;
this is purely technological to aid traditional storytelling.

Well the different layers of reality in a literal sense is physical, temporal,
mental, and emotional. I think actors experience a physical reality that reflects
them being physically there, which effects their mental reality of knowing that
none of it is real. Viewers no it's not real either, but it's easier for them
the forget and their emotional reality to be altered to *believe* it is. That's
what fiction is supposed to do.
