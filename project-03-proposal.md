Ok so there's this ongoing roleplay with some friends on discord I started, and
I think my character's story line would be pretty cool for a twine game. The
concept itself is that a group of very elderly people who were minutes away from
dying in their sleep were all magically sent back to high school in the 1950's
to fix the one regret that changed their lives forever and have a second chance.
That alone obviously makes a good opportunity for nonlinear story telling.
The game would follow my character Samson, or "Mavis." He goes by Mavis for
most of the story because his biggest regret is he never transitioned female
to male due to religious trauma, living his entire 85 years of life as a woman.
The game's present would be Samson in high school 2 electric boogaloo, but would
jump to different points of his life, anywhere between being a small child to
being almost completely lost by dementia. (also yes the game will have multiple
characters, There's Lucy a troubled love interest, Robin who's Lucy's childhood
friend and takes Samson under his wing, His scary ass parents, etc.)

I'm pretty sure I want to go with this because I love Samson a lot, but I might
not for a couple of reasons. One, I big part of Samson's story and self discovery
is dementia, and I'm not sure I can be educated enough in time to accurately
portray that. The other reason is that I'm not sure I want to do something trans
related. I really like sharing those stories and making what I wish I was able
to see as a kid, but there's more to me than that. Maybe I wanna make an adventure
game about a magic horse, IDK, I can branch out, it's possible...
