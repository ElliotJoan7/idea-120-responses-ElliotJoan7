### Contemperary Tools to Create Gesamtkunstwerk

This may seem a little silly, but the first thing that comes to mind when I hear "Contemperary Gesamtkunstwerk," I think of TikTok. Considering the man who coined the phrase was 
a composer for visual performance, it's actually not too far of a stretch. Since there's a vast variety of genres avaliable on the platform, Let's narrow it down to the cosplay 
subculture. There's a lot that goes into making a cosplay TikTok if you want it to look half way decent. First of all you have to put together a costume, which can range from 
a regular outfit and a wig to elaborate props that take months to build. Then when it's time to film, you have to figure out what you're going to actually *do*. You can act out a 
scene, lip sync, use your won voice, make a joke, etc. Either way, you're putting on a performance. Since TikTok is a screen performance, you have to find a way to rig up some 
lighting that works for the scene, as well as find a blank space in your home to film. I think cosplay TikTok is an excelent example of Gesamtkunstwerk because multiple art forms
have to come together to create the illusion that you're not a teenager in your parents' bathroom at 9 pm.

In terms of Rhizome, I think "The World in 24 Hours" fits Gesamtkunstwerk, if not a little too literally. I'm not too well versed in "internet jargon" so to speak, so it was 
difficult for me to conceptually understand what this actually looked like and how it even resulted in "art". However, form what i can desipher, it seems to me artists from all
over the world were invited to share their art through technological means. The Gesamtkunstwerk element, for me, comes from the fact that these pieces were sent in using various
levels of tech (telephones, fax machines, etc.) to ensure as much accessability as possible. The "whole body of art" in a sense could mean "as many people and elements as possible
contribute."
